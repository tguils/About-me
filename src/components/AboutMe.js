                    My name is Tess and I am a web developer in training. My educational and professional background has been in Social Work, where I have been working in the field for six years. When I'm not working or tinkering with code, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, and playing guitar and piano. In the past couple years I have decided to start my journey into becoming a web developer. I have enjoyed learning things on my own time, as well as, most recently, enrolling in a full stack coding bootcamp. I am expected to earn my certificate in September of 2023 after completing the course. This new path has been an exciting transition and experience for me.
