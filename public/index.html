            <p class="about-me-bio">Hello there, I'm Tess! I'm currently pursuing a career as a web developer, but my professional background lies in      social work. As a social worker, I've spent many years supporting families and individuals in difficult times. Being able to make a positive difference in people's lives is truly rewarding, and it's a passion that I carry with me in everything I do.
                <br><br>Along with my desire to help others, I've always had a knack for problem-solving. I love working on puzzles, formulas, and tinkering with different ideas until I find the right solution. This led me to discover coding and the endless possibilities it offers for creating innovative and functional websites.
               <br><br> The journey of learning to code has been an incredibly fulfilling one for me. As a beginner, I've had to put in a lot of time and effort to build my knowledge and skills, but the challenge has been well worth it. I'm constantly growing and improving my abilities, and I'm excited to see where this path will take me.
                <br><br>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing guitar or piano, hiking in the great outdoors, or curled up with a good book and my cat. I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.
